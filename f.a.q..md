# F.A.Q.

### I found a bug in the library, how do I report it?

To report a bug, simply go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/Team-Compliance/libraryofisaac/issues) on the github page and create a new issue.

Be sure to specify in what part of the library you found the issue, the error you're getting, what you are doing to experience it.

If possible you should also, try to recreate the error in a very small project and then link that to us.

### I'm getting an error like `attempt to call a table value`, what does it mean?

That error means that the code is trying to use a function that doesn't exist.

If you get this error in one of you lua files, check the spelling of your library function calls.

If the spelling seems correct or the error is coming from inside the library and you used the Build command from the extension, this will indicate that there has been an error when building the library and should be notified in the [issues tab](https://github.com/thicco-catto/Library-of-Isaac-Extension/issues) there.

If that still isn't the case, please report the bug in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Team-Compliance/libraryofisaac/issues).

### I want to contribute to the library, how can I?

Check the [Contributing to the Library](broken-reference) page.
